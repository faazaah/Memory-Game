 # Project 2 : The Memory Game
* The webpage displays an interactive card matching game. 
* The game works on the following logic :
	* Two cards can be clicked at a time to reveal them. If the cards match they stay open, or else the cards get 		hidden. 
	* A timer starts when the game begins, though the game is not a timed game.
	* Game can be restarted at any time, by clicking on the restart button.
	* Star rating is displayed based on the user's performance on the game. Increase in the number of moves, decreases 		the number of stars.
	* When all cards are matched, the user wins the game.
* This is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
